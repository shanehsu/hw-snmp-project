# snmp-project
This is a smal projec for a homework on Network Management course. The backend is built on Node.js, and talks to the network
equipment through SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c (the protocols supported by our underlying dependency). The backend is RESTful, but has no authentication.
You will find a simple frontend is included, built by a classmate of mine.
